# Code of Conduct

To keep it simple here is the philosophy:

```bible
Micah 6:8
He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.
    And what does the Lord require of you?
To act justly and to love mercy
    and to walk humbly[a] with your God.
```

[The Bible: NIV Micah 6:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah%206%3A8&version=NIV)

Act Justly. Love Mercy. Walk humbly with your God.
